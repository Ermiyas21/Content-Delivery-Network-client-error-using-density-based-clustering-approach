Master's Thesis

The growing number of Internet users and their increasing demand for the delivery of low-latency, multimedia content led to the emergence of content delivery networks (CDNs). CDNs consist of content server replicas set up close to the end users and usually serve data via HTTP(S). 

The dissemination of content on the Internet has gotten a lot of study interest; one of them is CDN client error. The data was collected from a seven-day real life proxy log from one of Europe's CDN providers, and the data set include errors from the client, server, and network. 

The main goal of this research is to find the origins of error with respect to host using clustering techniques such as Hierarchical agglomerative clustering (HAC) and density-based clustering techniques such as density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) and Hierarchical density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise HDBSAN. 

In this study we will apply the encoding techniques using Gower since the dataset is categorical. Internal and external clustering approaches are used to evaluate the model's performance.
